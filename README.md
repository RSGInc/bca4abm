bca4abm is an open platform for performing Benefit-cost analysis comparing scenarios generated
by travel demand models.  It is a general framework for aggregate (matrix), disaggregate, and link-based calculations and is implemented entirely with open source Python scientific computing libraries, most notably [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) for data tables and [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) for matrices.

# Need

Performance-based planning and programming is fundamental to improved project decision-making 
and is a core requirement of MAP-21. Benefit-cost analysis is a method that is widely used in 
national, state, and regional planning processes to assess the performance of transportation 
system investments, and is required by programs such as FHWAâ€™s TIGER discretionary grant program.
