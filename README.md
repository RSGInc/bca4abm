=======

bca4abm is an open platform for performing Benefit-cost analysis comparing scenarios generated
by activity-based travel models such as Daysim and CT-RAMP.

Performance-based planning and programming is fundamental to improved project decision-making 
and is a core requirement of MAP-21. Benefit-cost analysis is a method that is widely used in 
national, state, and regional planning processes to assess the performance of transportation 
system investments, and is required by programs such as FHWAâ€™s TIGER discretionary grant program.
