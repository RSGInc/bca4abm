# create activitysim development package
#####

cd ~/work

git clone https://github.com/toliwaga/activitysim.git ./activitysim

# install anaconda with python 2.7

conda update conda

~/anaconda/bin/conda create --name ampo --clone root

source ~/anaconda/bin/activate ampo

python setup.py develop


#####
# developer git setup
#####

# first fork the rsg repo in github
https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/

# now, on your local development machine
# clone YOUR fork which will be (conventionaly and automatically) be named 'origin'
cd ~/work
git clone https://github.com/toliwaga/bca4abm.git ./bca4abm

# and add the RSGInc repo as remote named (conventionally) 'upstream'
git remote add rsg https://github.com/RSGInc/bca4abm.git

# that way you can pull updates from the official repository
git pull rsg master

# if you accidentally cloned the RSGInc repo instead of your fork, all is not lost
# (untested)
git remote rename origin rsg
git remote add origin https://github.com/toliwaga/bca4abm.git
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master

# now things should look something like this:
# $ git remote -v
# origin	https://github.com/toliwaga/bca4abm.git (fetch)
# origin	https://github.com/toliwaga/bca4abm.git (push)
# rsg	https://github.com/RSGInc/bca4abm.git (fetch)
# rsg	https://github.com/RSGInc/bca4abm.git (push)

# developer workflow
#####

### create/checkout feature-branch
git branch feature-branch
git checkout feature-branch
# or
git checkout -b feature-branch

# at this point master will be tracking origin/master
# but the new branch is local (necessarily not a tracking branch)

### work...
echo "book" > dog.txt
git add .
git commit -a -m 'created book inside of a dog'

### push branch to origin
git push origin feature-branch

# origin/feature-branch has now been pushed, but local branch is NOT a tracking branch

# $ git pull
# There is no tracking information for the current branch.
# Please specify which branch you want to merge with.

### push branch to origin



# submit pull request
# bring up to date
git checkout master
git pull upstream master

# delete feature-branch locally and on remote
git checkout master
git branch -d feature-branch
git push origin --delete feature-branch
